        		<h2>What's this all about?</h2>
				<p>I like to write, its a comfortable way for me to express myself. 

					I might share photos, workouts, thoughts, ask questions, reviews, some nonsense, probably.
					
					Feel free to stick around or pop in as you please.

			<h3>The things that I enjoy.</h3>
				<p> As of the last year, running has been a big interest. 
				I ran my first half marathon in September 2024. My first marathon will be the Chicago Marathon in October 2025.
				
				<p>Aside from that, yoga, strength training, bike, play softball, golf, kayak, hike and whatever else I want to try. 
				I plan on spending more time at the beach this year, I slacked last year.
